		<p>since i specifically mentioned the metaverse, i’ll start with one of my favorite projects in development right now.</p>
		<p>(a link here to staratlas.com) star atlas. </p>
		<p>star atlas is attempting to innovate and disrupt both the gaming and crypto industries by integrating the economies of the real world and the digital sphere. This is the idea behind the metaverse: just make the digital stuff mean a whole lot more. </p>
		<p>to be honest im not sure if this is the best idea. people fight over internet shit so throwing money into the mix doesnt seem all that conducive to moving forward as a society, but what the fuck do i know. all we can do is consider the implications of what is happening around us and move accordingly. kinda like this:<br>
            <p class="minefield"><img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/l1J9y0rf8zncJDztm/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e473yg4oljf21lr3vcudckj7lju9xk7e5ehfgn28opf&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g" alt="life" width="400" height="250"></p>
		<p>The game is supposed to be this mmorpg where youre essentially living a simulated life in this intergalactic society some hundreds of years into the future. Im not personally into the lore all that much (yet) but you can check out more here ( <a href="https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/Main_Page">(link)</a></p>
		<p>getting into it a little deeper, the gameplay is a blend of star citizen, gta, and your favorite turn-based strategy games. As a member of one of 3 different factions, you will have the option of doing any specific or combination of things including but not limited to: </p>
		<ul> ship building</ul>
		<ul>resource gathering</ul>
		<ul>piracy</ul>
		<ul>trading </ul>
		<ul>security</ul>
		<ul>transportation</ul>

		<p>the game is set in space that is split into 3 zones: low, medium, and high risk with varying rules and consequences to each. </p>

	<h2> I mentioned that the game is tied into crypto, so ill go into a little depth on that now. </h2>
		<p>Now i know what you may be thinking if you’re not already involved with this kind of stuff… (span text and emphasize it in a way to communicate disdain) crypto????</p>
		<p>Yes. unlike games like fifa or gta that use worthless in game currency that you spend real money on to buy digital goods that you cant even sell to other players for neither real nor digital currency, star atlas is built on 2 (span text to emphasize & also include a link to solana docs) solana program library tokens.</p>
		<ol>polis</ol>
		<ol>atlas </ol>

		<p>These 2 tokens live on the solana blockchain and are composable in the network between all users (whether they play or not), and (a link to an article about) defi protocols like (a links to) tulip francium and step</p> 
		<p>ATLAS is used to acquire digital assets such as ships, crew, components, land, and equipment but it is also used for business operating expenses, such as personnel for mining equipment, fuel for ships, and repairs for damages.</p>
		<p>Polis is the governance token for the yet to be implemented (a link to) the star atlas DAO, where voting weight will be distributed based on token ownership and decisions relating to in-game mechanics and also decisions like hiring 3rd party studios to improve/create new content will be made. </p>
